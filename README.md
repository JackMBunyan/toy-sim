# TOYSIM

A business simulation for developing teamworking skills and business acumen.

## Idea:

Design a simualtion game where multiple companies compete to design toys for a model market of the UK. Each team will need to balance their finance sheets and make decisions based on market research on how to produce, where to sell and at what price their toys will be on the market for.
